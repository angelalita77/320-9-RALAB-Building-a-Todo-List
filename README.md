# ALAB 320H.9.1 - Building a Todo List

### Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, learners will have demonstrated the ability to:

Use the useReducer and/or useImmerReducer hook to manage state with reducer functions.
Use useState in places where reducers are not appropriate or necessary.
Implement controlled forms and inputs.
Effectively decide where pieces of state should live.
Use conditional rendering and conditional styling to provide a positive, interactive user experience.
Create a complete React application from a set of desired functionality.

### About The Software

## üìù To-Do List Application Requirements

This table tracks the implementation status of all features outlined in the project brief.

| Requirement No. | Feature Description | Implementation Status | Notes |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **1.** | Heading labeling the list as "Todo List". | [x] | |
| **2.** | List of todo items, each with text, checkbox, and delete/edit buttons. | [x] | Base component structure established. |
| **2.A.** | **Checkbox** indicating completion status. | [x] | Logic to toggle the `isComplete` state. |
| **2.B.** | **Delete** button next to each item. | [x] | |
